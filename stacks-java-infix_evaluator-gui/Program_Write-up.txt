My original write up for the university seems to have become a victim of my
digital house cleaning.

If my memory serves me correct, this was our first application of Java's stack
implementation. This program takes an infix expression, pushes it into a stack,
and pops the expression when the correct token is identified.

My apologies if you are actually reading this and do not see my test data.

This is only intended to show potential employers some of my coding efforts.
