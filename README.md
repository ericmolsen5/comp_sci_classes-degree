# comp_sci_classes-degree

### Description

This is a repository of my coding projects that I've done as part of my Computer Science
studies. I've taken efforts to obfuscate what exact class and assignment the project was for
so I don't cross any academic boundaries. 

## Java

The majority of my assignments have been in Java. Several data structure assignments are 
included here

## C++

So far I've developed one simple C++ program. It is implemented in Visual Studio.
