# comp_sci_classes-degree

### Description

This is just a repository of my coding projects that I've done as part of my Computer Science
studies. I've taken efforts to obfuscate what exact class and assignment the project was for
so I don't cross any academic boundaries. 

## Java

Most of my assignments have been in Java. Whenever I am required to build more complex code
in other languages, I will add those accordingly.

If you have any questions or comments, please attach them to this Github forum.
